------------

This small script is used to connect to multiple MikroTik routers and run the command that is entered on line 18 of the **`MikroTik_Remote_Command.sh`** script.

The script will only work if the routers are already registered on your` .ssh/known_hosts` file.

If you need to add multiple MikroTik's to your known_hosts file  run `ssh-keyscan`.
